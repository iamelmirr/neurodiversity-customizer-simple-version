# Privacy Policy for Neurodiversity Web Page Customizer

*Last Updated: June 15, 2025*

## Introduction

Thank you for using the Neurodiversity Web Page Customizer ("Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how our Extension collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use it to customize web pages for improved accessibility and comfort.

## Information We Collect

### User Activity
The Extension monitors certain user activity solely for the purpose of providing its core functionality:

- **Mouse position**: Used only to position the reading ruler in Focus Mode, which follows your cursor to help maintain reading focus.
- **Scroll position**: Used to adjust visual elements like the reading ruler as you navigate through a page.
- **Click interactions**: Used only to toggle between different visual modes and settings within the Extension.

### Website Content
The Extension accesses website content to apply visual modifications:

- **Text**: Accessed to modify font styles, spacing, and contrast for better readability.
- **Images and media**: Accessed to adjust contrast, brightness, and saturation levels for reduced visual stimulation in certain modes.
- **Page structure**: Accessed to identify main content areas versus peripheral content for Focus Mode.

## How We Use Information

All information collection occurs **locally on your device only**. The Extension:

- **Never transmits** any user activity or website content to our servers or any third parties.
- **Never stores** browsing history, page content, or interaction data beyond the current browsing session.
- **Only saves** your selected visual mode preference in your browser's local storage to maintain your settings between sessions.

The sole purpose of accessing this information is to apply visual modifications that improve the accessibility and usability of web pages for neurodiverse users.

## Data Storage

The only data stored by the Extension is:

- Your preferred visual mode (Default, Dyslexia-Friendly, Focus, High Contrast, or Calm)
- Any custom settings related to these modes

This information is stored using Chrome's local storage API and remains on your device. It is not synced across devices or accessible to anyone but you.

## Third-Party Access

We do not share any data with third parties. The Extension:

- Does not use analytics services
- Does not include any tracking technologies
- Does not integrate with external services
- Does not contain any advertising components

## Your Rights and Choices

You can:

- Clear all saved preferences by uninstalling the Extension
- Use the Default Mode to temporarily disable all modifications
- Control exactly which websites the Extension affects through browser settings

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will post the updated Privacy Policy on our Chrome Web Store listing and update the "Last Updated" date.
